Visual journalists and those who manage visual news productions are accountable for upholding the following standards in their daily work:
	1.	Be accurate and comprehensive in the representation of subjects.
	2.	Resist being manipulated by staged photo opportunities.
	3.	Be complete and provide context when photographing or recording subjects. Avoid stereotyping individuals and groups. Recognize and work to avoid presenting one's own biases in the work.
	4.	Treat all subjects with respect and dignity. Give special consideration to vulnerable subjects and compassion to victims of crime or tragedy. Intrude on private moments of grief only when the public has an overriding and justifiable need to see.
	5.	While photographing subjects do not intentionally contribute to, alter, or seek to alter or influence events.
	6.	Editing should maintain the integrity of the photographic images' content and context. Do not manipulate images or add or alter sound in any way that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.
	7.	Do not pay sources or subjects or reward them materially for information or participation.
	8.	Do not accept gifts, favors, or compensation from those who might seek to influence coverage.
	9.	Do not intentionally sabotage the efforts of other journalists.
 
 
Photos reveal media’s softer tone on opioid crisis - Columbia Journalism Review
https://www.cjr.org/criticism/opioid-crisis-photos.php

I think the examples in this CJR article are cherry-picked to support the author’s point of view. Media outlets still publish plenty of photos and videos of heroin addicts who have overdosed in cars, stores, etc. that shame and stigmatize the people in the pictures.

## Chris Arnade
 
Chris Arnade is the photographer we mentioned who has spent a lot of time photographing addicts—and openly admits that he sometimes gives his subjects money to buy drugs. 
 
His photos are striking and real. But is Chris Arnade a journalist?

A CARING LENS ON THE OPIOID CRISIS

PHOTOGRAPHS BY JEFFREY STOCKBRIDGE

This is a recent LA Times story about a prominent medical school dean at USC who had a hidden drug habit. This story mentions that the LA Times saw videos/images of him using drugs but I don't think they published any of them -- possibly for legal reasons or maybe the person who provided them didn't give permission. But my take is that the tone of this whole expose is on the lurid details of this man's drug use, partying, and socializing with young addicts and doesn't really delve into the question of how someone could hold such a prominent position and yet also have what seems to be a serious drug problem. Or was he one of those people who was a more casual user? This gets to the concept of the functional addict and why we in the media don't explore that, therefore creating the public perception that addiction looks like the far end of the spectrum -- someone who is clearly unhealthy and down and out.

An overdose, a young companion, drug-fueled parties: The secret life of USC med school dean

TIMES STAFF MEMBERS PAUL PRINGLE, HARRIET RYAN, ADAM ELMAHREK, MATT HAMILTON AND SARAH PARVINI REPORTED THIS STORY.

JULY 17, 2017

In USC’s lecture halls, labs and executive offices, Dr. Carmen A. Puliafito was a towering figure. The dean of the Keck School of Medicine was a renowned eye surgeon whose skill in the operating room was matched by a gift for attracting money and talent to the university.

There was another side to the Harvard-educated physician.

During his tenure as dean, Puliafito kept company with a circle of criminals and drug users who said he used methamphetamine and other drugs with them, a Los Angeles Times investigation found.

Puliafito, 66, and these much younger acquaintances captured their exploits in photos and videos. The Times reviewed dozens of the images.

Shot in 2015 and 2016, they show Puliafito and the others partying in hotel rooms, cars, apartments and the dean’s office at USC.

In one video, a tuxedo-clad Puliafito displays an orange pill on his tongue and says into the camera, “Thought I’d take an ecstasy before the ball.” Then he swallows the pill.

In another, Puliafito uses a butane torch to heat a large glass pipe outfitted for methamphetamine use. He inhales and then unleashes a thick plume of white smoke. Seated next to him on a sofa, a young woman smokes heroin from a piece of heated foil.

As dean, Puliafito oversaw hundreds of medical students, thousands of professors and clinicians, and research grants totaling more than $200 million. He was a key fundraiser for USC, bringing in more than $1 billion in donations, by his estimation...



 
Closing Down a Notorious Heroin Camp in Philadelphia
https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/08/closing-down-a-notorious-heroin-camp-in-philadelphia/536232/

Earlier this year, AFP photographer Dominick Reuter and Getty photographer Spencer Platt both visited the Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to photograph “El Campamento,” one of the largest open-air drug markets and shooting galleries on the East Coast, before it was shut down. According to Getty: “People come from throughout the city, and some as far away as the Midwest, for heroin that is remarkably cheap and pure.” At the end of July, the encampment, littered with mattresses, used needles and other refuse, started to be cleaned up and closed down by city workers and Consolidated Rail employees, while outreach workers try to help place homeless residents of the camp. Getty further reported that “over 900 people died last year in Philadelphia from opioid overdoses, a 30 percent increase from 2015.”

From Drugs to Mugs: Shocking before and after images show the cost of drug addiction

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/pictures/8345461/From-Drugs-to-Mugs-Shocking-before-and-after-images-show-the-cost-of-drug-addiction.html

These shocking before and after images reveal the effects of drug addiction on the human face. 'From Drugs to Mugs' is the follow up to the controversial 2004 'Faces of Meth' release which highlighted the effects of methamphetamine use.

Released in the hope that they will make kids think twice about ever touching drugs, the pictures show how addicts have lost teeth and scratched their skin to the bone.

"Faces of Meth went round the world, it caused revulsion and captured people's imagination," said deputy Bret King, 45, who was instrumental in putting together the original Faces of Meth project in 2004.

"As I was putting together the project and touring the country trying to highlight the effects of meth on people, I had a nagging feeling that I knew I wasn't bringing the whole picture to people's attention. Every single person I booked and interviewed who was not just a meth addict but a heroin user or a coke-head had started on some seemingly innocent drug like alcohol or cannabis."

Faced with an endemic drug problem in the north west of the United States, the Multnomah Sheriff's Office has also produced a heart-wrenching educational documentary to aid in its fight against young people turning to drugs.

Expanding their presentation which is to be aired in high schools across America, deputy King and his team interviewed 300 adult inmates at Multnomah County's Inverness Jail.

"We want everyone, not just high school kids to look at these pictures and to be shocked," said King. "People think that drug enforcement and the battle against drugs is a bit blasé and boring but it isn't. Everyone should be reminded of the dangers of drugs, especially when so many casually take them."
