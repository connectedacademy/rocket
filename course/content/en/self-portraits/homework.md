  ‘Tell us the story of something that isn’t there.’ In preparation for the
  class you should create a context-rich image. Use the Four Corners Editor to
  add rich meta-data addressing the theme of Absence. Whether the image is new
  or old, one of yours or someone else’s is up to you, but the information
  should add new layers of meaning for the reader.

## This week's task

It is easy for photographers to respond to the way things look, and harder to respond to what things mean. For this activity you should tell the story of a subject that is not present within the frame. Your images will have to signify absence or loss, they will have to show traces of a presence. The evidence of something that is missing.

It might be useful to think about denotation and connotation, the signifier and the signified. We do this all the time when we use emojis, a thumbs-up denotes a severed hand, but means “Okay!“, just as a heart denotes an internal organ, but means “love” or "affection". 
When Dalia chooses to balance a frame with one empty and one occupied chair either side, she prompts us to ask why? What does this empty chair signify? To whom does it belong and why aren’t they there?
