expectsubmission: false
description: >-
  The World Press Photo Foundation Archive contains over sixty years of iconic
  images. We have selected photographs that relate in osme way to the issues
  being covered in the session, and reimagined them as Four Corners Images. It
  is an example of how 4C can be creatively adapted to add rich meta-date to
  historical images. Instead of the frames before and after, we have included
  contemporaneous and subject-related images. For the codes of ethics we have
  substituted the World Press Photo Foundation Competition rules.
