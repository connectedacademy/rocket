00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
Hello my name is Jonathan Worth and as
well as being freelance photographer I'm

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,760
also a researcher at Newcastle
University's Open Lab in the UK.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,220
The interviews you're about to hear are part
of a series that, along with the web platform

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,600
and connected classes, seek to
create a space for

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,000
critical engagement with visual storytelling.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,040
The relationship between the photographer, the subject and the audience

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,080
(the three stakeholders in every photograph)

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,220
are central to the Talking Pictures
interviews, but there are occasions when

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,480
those stakeholders might not be three
different people.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,680
In the case of the self-portrait, the photographer and the subject to the same person.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,940
In the case of the selfie that isn't shared or
published, the photographer, the subject

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,686
and the audience are one and the same.

13
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:45,860
The theme for this session is "Interpretation" and the people who have

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,640
agreed to help us think about that are

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,260
the Scottish photographer Graham Macindoe and the U.S. journalist Susan Stellan.

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,100
For reasons that will become
clear

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,660
Graham chose not to share his
self-portraits for over ten years

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,049
and many of the images from this series
and from this time in his life,

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,860
he's still not chosen to publish.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,780
Both him and Susan reflect on the ethical implications

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,940
of representing other people, the duty of care for the vulnerable

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,160
and they consider how the
effect and impact of an image might be

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,020
felt long after it was made, and long
after the subject

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,560
may have moved on with their life.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,570
I first met Graham in New York in 1998 he helped me

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,482
find a place to live and help me find places to work.

27
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:28,720
He was intense. He was brash with his

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,960
thick Scottish accent that he refused to
let go of, and he was funny.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,380
He was generous, he was very caring of his
friends, and he was successful as well.

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,320
He was shooting huge jobs. He was travelling all over the world.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,040
He someone who was constantly in motion,
both figuratively and literally.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,940
He was also a compulsive collector both of the ephemeral and of images.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,920
Everything had a story attached to it and everything was super tasteful.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,740
To this day the photographs of that period of my life, that hang in my home, were made by Graham.

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,079
We moved away from New York at the end
of 2001 and towards the end it had

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,360
become harder and harder to keep up with
him.

37
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,300
By 2005 it was impossible and it remains a regret that we lost touch.

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,140
Back in the UK news of Graham now was

39
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,640
coming second and third-hand. I learned
that he he'd got divorced.

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,520
I'd learned that he wasn't working anymore.

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,120
I learned that there'd been a newspaper report of an explosion at his house,

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,080
that he'd been arrested, and that finally he was in prison.

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,280
As you listen to this interview you'll hear from Graham the photographer,

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,780
Graham the subject and
Graham the publisher.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,640
You'll hear how even at his lowest ebb he was still considering the ethical implications of

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,140
making other people's images, and how he
and Susan chose to share the work,

47
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,840
taking into consideration how the contexts
would affect how the various audiences

48
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,774
would interpret it and be affected.

49
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,140
And so it's fitting that Susan has the last word,

50
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,560
not only on this story, but also on
this interview itself.

51
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,440
There are also links to related bodies of work that, along with this material, should inform

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,150
a critical discourse about vulnerability,
responsibility and how we choose to

53
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,060
represent issues and so frame the conversations around them.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,799
[Graham] My name's Graham Macindoe and I'm speaking to you guys from Brooklyn, New York in my

55
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,489
living room, and you might hear a few
cars going by because  I'm pretty close to the expressway.

56
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:32,389
I grew up in Scotland between
Edinburgh and Glasgow and you know,

57
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:38,450
I spent a lot of my youth being into music
and specifically punk music in the late

58
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,450
70's and through the 80's and I went
to art school in Edinburgh where I

59
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,269
actually studied painting and then to
London where  I went to the Royal College which

60
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,739
was quite a jump for me because I hadn't
studied photography at all.

61
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,329
I'd studied painting but I'd always taken photographs and somehow I managed to get into the Royal College

62
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,360
which was still pretty amazing to me, because it was very prestigious at the time.

63
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,960
And then after two years at the Royal College where I met my then-girlfriend

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,100
and had my son Liam. I moved to New York to follow a career in photography.

65
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,120
When I first moved to New York I wasn't
sure what I was going to do in photography.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
I knew I wanted to work within the field of photography, I fallen in love with it

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,550
and was pretty passionate about it,

68
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,380
but the five years I spent working in galleries. But because I was always taking pictures,

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
I eventually moved on into working commercially as a photographer.

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,400
Before I knew it I was photographing for a lot of magazines, working on commercial ad campaigns,

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,140
getting flown all over the world to do
annual reports and photographing

72
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,280
Gary Oldman, I photographed Michael
Jackson. I got sent a film sets so I was

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,200
photographing, you know, for Nike and ESPN  so the trajectory at that point was

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,340
really, really quick for me. It wasn't I really envisaged for myself -

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,140
working at that level as a commercial photographer.

76
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,900
People would do stuff for you and so it was very foreign to me. I was always really surprised when people

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,840
threw money at you and then give you more money to buy your breakfast and your lunch and a

78
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,740
cup of coffee and someone to  help you and  a taxi and all that sort of stuff.

79
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,780
That world which really surprising to me. Very, very surprising to me. Even I thought that

80
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,760
I was it was too much money sometimes and I was getting paid it.

81
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,360
But of course not all photography is really well  paid, you know? I mean photojournalism and editorial

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,200
I think is... you can make a living and it's
a good living but yet you're not getting

83
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,020
paid what you're getting paid for
shooting advertising campaigns and

84
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,560
that's where the real money comes in.

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,320
It was interesting to be, you know, in a position

86
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,710
where people would call you up and say:
"Hey, you available next week? We would

87
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,520
like to send you to L.A. to photograph Randy Newman.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,380
We're doing an article on him,  but I've often

89
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,340
found that its the people that you get
sent that have an interesting

90
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,140
story about them, that are not on that
celebrity band-waggon, that

91
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,780
are more inclined to give you more time and
more inclined to reveal things about themselves.

92
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,660
Even if you don't agree with it. I've photographed some people that

93
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,980
politically, I might not agree with, or you
know, or some of their stances, I'm just like...

94
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,740
Wow! But they  always have something interesting about them that reveals something to me about how other people live their lives.

95
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
Those jobs are more fulfilling for me.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,380
I enjoyed that sort of,  you know,  meeting these people who are not in the public eye

97
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,230
or they might be doing something that's slightly interesting and someone's picked up on it

98
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,760
and saw some magazines doing a feature on it.

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,660
I started working as a photographer because

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,500
I was someone who was always
taking pictures. I took portraits of friends,

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,670
I photographed landscapes, I did.. I photographed everything that was going on around me you know,

102
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,020
because I really loved photography. 
I still take pictures now.

103
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,340
I've always taken pictures. I mean I just..

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
.. sometimes I think it's are almost like an affliction.

105
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,960
I encourage all my students to keep
sketchbooks and notebooks you know,

106
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,120
I don't like them to be taking out and
writing notes on their phones.

107
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,380
I like them to be carrying sketchbooks you know,

108
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,880
I tell them and I send them on the first day

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,540
in class at the beginning of semester,
go to the store it's just round the corner,

110
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,650
spend five bucks, buy a sketchbook and
just write your ideas and then scribble

111
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,860
ideas and if you find a piece of paper
or a picture on the street or a Polaroid

112
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,730
or whatever it is, stick it in there. When
you look back through it will be much

113
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,900
more meaningful than a note on your
iPhone that you can delete accidentally

114
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,760
and doesn't have any real aesthetic
value. I still do it but I try to get

115
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,140
my students to do it  a lot, you know.

116
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,340
People, especially now, people are very

117
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,550
interested in seeing what your vision is
and what you can bring to the table

118
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,460
as opposed to what you've brought to the
table for other people.

119
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,180
So I've had several years of working as a really successful commercial photographer,

120
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,660
working editorially, working for
advertising agencies, flying all around the world.

121
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,860
Being lucky enough to meet
celebrities and you know, sort of the dream

122
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,480
world of a photographer to be perfectly
honest with you.

123
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,540
But er.. . during that period

124
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,700
I'd started drinking too much, I'd started
dabbling with drugs and..

125
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,840
it just took me off at a tangent that I never, ever really expected in my life you know.

126
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,420
I slowly but surely and very insidiously,
the drugs kicked in and I became a very,

127
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,220
very bad heroin and crack cocaine addict.

128
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,300
Susan:

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,140
I first met Graham Macindoe in 2002 when we were both part of the same Summer house

130
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,700
out in Montauk at the end of Long Island, near New York.

131
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,920
At the time he was
working as a commercial photographer

132
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,800
There were a lot of us who kind of
came and went to that house over the

133
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,690
course of the summer and I really just
knew him as someone who partied a bit

134
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,720
and drink, I would say, more than the
average person.

135
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,900
At the time he had a girlfriend

136
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,540
and we sort of lost touch over that, after that Summer.

137
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:11,240
Then I reached out to him in 2005, when I needed an author photo taken for a travel book I'd written,

138
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
and went over to get my picture taken,

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,360
at that point Graham wasn't in that relationship anymore, I wasn't in a relationship,

140
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,660
and by the end of that very long photoshoot in that afternoon

141
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,560
the next day he asked me out on a date.

142
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,880
I was living on the Upper West Side,

143
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,917
he was living in Brooklyn and in New York we joked

144
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,340
that that's sort of a long-distance relationship.

145
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,840
You know we really only saw each other on weekend so

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,140
it took a while for me to realise that
there was something..

147
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,160
a little bit off about him.

148
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,540
We tend to see and experience
addiction as viewers at the extreme end of the spectrum

149
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,940
you know we don't really have a popular conception of the "functional addict".

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,260
So, for me, the idea that Graham could be functional as a photographer

151
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,700
and a guy that I would be interested in dating..

152
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,720
at first people just would ask well how could you not have known

153
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,740
it wasn't obvious to me and

154
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,860
you know we have pictures from a trip we
took to Hawaii

155
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,740
and my Mom when she saw this photos,

156
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,720
she said "oh he looks so wholesome".

157
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,640
Unbeknownst to me or really anyone else he was using heroin at the time.

158
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,540
I was still working for many years during that time

159
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,860
so I thought,  I'm still working, I'm making money I'm not that bad you know,

160
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,000
this is just a period I'm going through but, you know,

161
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
as you get more and more in to drugs

162
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,280
your awareness of where you are and what's going on with you fitters-away and..

163
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,980
by the time I.. sort of realised.. and tried to do anything about it, I was really deep in.

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,660
I eventually found out that Graham was using drugs when I found him

165
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,240
sitting on the couch in his house at the crack pipe.

166
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,100
For a variety of reasons I didn't end up breaking up with him right then

167
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,480
so I sort of stuck around for a while

168
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,280
you know, and then until it became apparent that he really just

169
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,760
wasn't getting the help and I thought, me
being/continuing in a relationship

170
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,520
was actually hurting things more than was
helping.

171
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,720
And think I had this, feeling that you know
we all have that, sort of tough love

172
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,860
if I just walk away..  you know, that's going to motivate him to quit

173
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,200
I've always taken pictures and even in the depths of my addiction, where I didn't work

174
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,580
commercially for years, and my whole
life was unraveling and

175
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,180
I'd isolated myself from everyone that I knew

176
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,280
and I was on a very, very slippery, dark downhill path I was still taking pictures

177
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,160
but it wasn't only the pictures that I was taking that were, sort of, from that period

178
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,540
I collected all the (being a compulsive collector of things in my whole life),

179
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,980
and so I.. I was intrigued by the design of the heroin baggies that I was buying around New York City

180
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,600
I didn't see it as collecting at a time, I just kept them because I was intrigued by them, I loved the designs,

181
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,540
I loved the quirky little pictures with
guns and cartoon characters and you know,

182
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,080
statements on them that were just
totally over the top sometimes.

183
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,500
so I'd be sticking them in books or little boxes and stuff like that and also just other

184
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,260
things that were going on around me you
know I was writing in scrapbooks,

185
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,000
you know, I was keeping letters I was keeping.. I got arrested a number of times,

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,100
I kept the arrest warrants. I kept all that sort of stuff. Court appearances, rehab papers, stuck them in boxes.

187
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,680
I was surprised when I came through all that sort of stuff and got myself clean

188
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,260
and a couple of different friends of mine had stuck stuff in storage

189
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,080
or kept things in their houses for me and I started pulling that stuff together

190
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,180
I started finding all this stuff
again. I started finding the heroin baggies

191
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,480
and the notebooks and the
Polaroids and the undeveloped rolls of

192
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,320
35mm film and 120 film and, and then I
started finding all these cards

193
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,100
hundreds and hundreds of pictures I had taken during those years over maybe

194
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,480
six or seven years, and not really.. knowing I was doing it, and sometimes looking on

195
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,040
sometimes not looking at them and sometimes losing the cards

196
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,420
and sometimes having the cameras stolen by other junkies.

197
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,240
I didn't feel I had the right to show the pictures of the other people that I'd photographed

198
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,080
because the consent thing with addicts is very, very difficult

199
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,600
you'll say and do a lot of things as an addict ..

200
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,280
and say everything's okay then

201
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,880
the reality of day when you're clean you
just go "My God I would never do or say that"

202
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,460
so I've decided to make it all
about me.

203
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,740
[Susan] Another point in the code of ethics is "Give special consideration to
vulnerable subjects"

204
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,300
and that's something that Graham has addressed in explaining why he decided not to photograph other addicts

205
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,800
is this issue of consent.
You know, we recognise now that someone

206
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,400
who is addicted to drugs and has a
serious problem, you know,

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,319
they have difficulties with decision-making and making rational choices. So, to say that

208
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,880
this person can consent to having their
picture taken and then published I think

209
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,500
is a bit problematic because, you know, we
recognise that you know,

210
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,720
they aren't really making decisions that are
informed by rational choices

211
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,000
and I think that is something that we really need to think about because

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,420
that person might get clean and then later regret that their images out in the world

213
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,420
showing them at their worst moment and
they can't take it back.

214
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,000
[Graham] I had started taking photographs of the people around me in their environment

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,740
and sometimes I've ended up in the pictures and then

216
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,220
it just felt more pertinent for me to photograph myself because I was living that life and

217
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,720
I shouldn't really be pointing the camera at other people I felt I should be pointed it at myself.

218
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,740
[Susan] So fast forward a few years and I had
lost touch with him at that point

219
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,580
he had really gone downhill.

220
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,240
We kept in touch occasionally via email but then,

221
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,960
he just disappeared off the radar, and I started reaching out to a couple other people who had known him.

222
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,760
Just sort of under the assumption that maybe he'd overdosed

223
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,580
because his phone had been turned off. The website he used to promote his photography was offline.

224
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,040
[Graham] I mean I spent close to a decade of my life juggling too much drinking dabbling with drugs

225
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,319
turning, into a serious addiction,  and

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
everything that went along with that.

227
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,060
And I kept telling myself that I could get clean on my own.

228
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,320
I kept thinking it was something I could do. Just to willpower and strength,

229
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,520
and it's just like, I just need
to buckle down and do it, but you know,

230
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,100
I was totally incapable.

231
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,060
Strangely enough the most devastating thing for me at that time

232
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,600
was a finally been arrested and sentenced to six months in Rikers Island,

233
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,760
which is a prison on an island on the outskirts of New York City

234
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,100
and I think it's one of the biggest penal colonies in the world,

235
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,880
which totally blew me away
because

236
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,520
it was somewhere I never, ever thought I would end up in.

237
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,000
So I "cold-turkeyed" in a cell in Rikers Island, which was a really, really painful thing you know?

238
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,980
The physicality of it.

239
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,660
And then once you get that out of your system a little bit, the readjusting in your body to being clean

240
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,380
and then psychologically the..
you know, realisation of where the last

241
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,439
several years of your life have been, are
really crushing you know?

242
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:28,659
I mean it was a really, really tough time for me but I also gave me that moment of clarity,

243
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,829
as they call it,  where I sort of could look back and say "Wow!", I just put myself through this

244
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,970
and my friends through this, and my family
through this, and thinking of the collateral

245
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,980
damage to my Mom and my Dad and my
friends and my son and everyone was really big.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,440
[Susan] By the time I tracked him
down he was actually due to be released from Rikers and

247
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,520
rather than getting released, he ended up in Homeland Security custody

248
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,840
and was very quickly moved to detention centres in, first in downtown Manhattan,

249
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,440
and then in New Jersey, and then Pennsylvania.

250
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,240
So I managed to get someone at the prison
where he was being held in Pennsylvania

251
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,920
to give him my phone number and that's
when we reconnected.

252
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,459
[Graham] I was in a County Jail in Pennsylvania that had an immigration wing and I found out they had a

253
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,939
24/7 cognitive behavioural therapy
program in there for four months

254
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,020
and that's, that's how I got clean
essentially, was in a prison rehabilitation program.

255
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,080
And it set the groundwork for me to, when I got out,  to build on that

256
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,900
and I've been clean ever since which is seven and half years, or something like that.

257
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,600
[Susan] We talked on the phone, we exchanged these
really intense letters, and you know by

258
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,549
the time his final hearing was coming up,
it was as lawyer who actually asked if I

259
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:47,600
would be okay with Graham coming to stay
with me for a while if he got released?

260
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,930
So all of a sudden he was on a bus
getting out at

261
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,160
the Port Authority Terminal near Times
Square in New York and that was the

262
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,980
first time we saw each other when we
were not separated by Plexiglas.

263
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,600
That was the first time I seen him in almost two years so, he came to stay with me and

264
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,720
he's still here! Could never get rid of
him [laughs] we actually just got married in May of 2017

265
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,640
But when he was released, maybe not nine months clean but also

266
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,970
having spent nine months incarcerated, so
he wasn't Graham the photographer.

267
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,679
I think he didn't know who he was and that was the process of rebuilding, you know not

268
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,720
just from that time away from everything,
but also almost a decade of addiction.

269
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,940
So, it was a long process, I mean he, at first
he didn't have any interest in picking up a camera

270
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,740
he would go to a grocery store and just stand in the aisles kind of mystified by

271
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,260
the amount of choice that you had because all that's taken away when you're incarcerated.

272
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,320
You know, he didn't have any interest in having a phone.

273
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,760
He didn't have any interest in a computer. You know, it took a long time for Graham to

274
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,020
you know feel pleasure again from the things that

275
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,940
I feel pleasure from. You know, whether it's a great meal, or sex, or running, or

276
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,130
photography, you know, and that's because
your brain changes from addiction you

277
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,280
know, particularly with dopamine's and
you know,

278
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,880
I don't think people get prepared for how long that's going to take.

279
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,560
[Graham] So now that I've been clean for a bit and I've started pulling together my life

280
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,720
and have rediscovered all this.. sort of
ephemera and stuff,

281
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,940
the photographs, the baggies, the notebooks, the Polaroids all that sort of stuff from the

282
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,000
years of addiction, I'd spent a lot of time
looking through them and, it was somewhat

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,580
upsetting for me and sort of.. looking at
these because even though I was clean

284
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,200
now and I was happy I was clean and I was
not 100% comfortable talking to people

285
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,340
about what I've been through because I
was still in that place that's sort of.. as an

286
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,060
addict your shame-based, because it's not
like some that you boast about is being

287
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,630
a heroine addict, or a crack addict. Its something that you're pretty ashamed of know?

288
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,310
So, its a difficult thing to reveal
to people and some people.. a lot of people

289
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,260
knew about it, some people didn't, and I
would bump into people who would say

290
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,040
"Oh, where have you been the last few years? I haven't heard from you in ages, what's been going on?"

291
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,940
and the last thing you want to say is

292
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,240
"Oh, hey! It's good to see you I've been a heroin addict I was locked up in prison"

293
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,560
[Susan]  The first time I saw them I mean it was just gut-wrenching

294
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,400
and it was it was so devastating

295
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,120
but also at the same time compelling, because it showed me what Graham had been up to

296
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,740
in these rooms and stairwells and places
that I'd never seen and I actually wrote

297
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,730
about it in a journal at the time where
I kind of described that attraction and

298
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,720
this voyeurism to wanting to know about
this part of his life he'd kept hidden,

299
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,820
but then also how sad it was because
what Graham chose to show was

300
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,360
so much loneliness and in all the photos you know, by and large, he's by himself

301
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,340
and just what his life had been reduced to.

302
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,820
[Graham] It took a lot of time looking at them

303
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,430
because some of the pictures were really,
really, really disturbing and some of the

304
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,350
really disturbing ones I haven't put out
there because it's too rough on my

305
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:31,960
family and my wife and myself even, for
people to see certain images.

306
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,080
They're just too tough, you know? 
They show me in a light I just don't want to share .

307
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,840
[Susan] When he did start showing them to people there were really a range of reactions.

308
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,140
One friend of ours just, you know, ran crying from the room when she first saw them.

309
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,040
[Graham] It was hard looking at it, and it was hard working out at who the audience would be.

310
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,440
Why would I want to show it? 
Who would this resonate with?

311
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,320
And what would be their takeaway?

312
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,460
It was like I took these pictures of myself and...

313
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,800
this is what I went through and I
want you to understand people end up in

314
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,372
this situation and what they go through, and..

315
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,320
that they can recover as well.

316
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,740
It's really important to me the, you know,
the takeaway for this is that

317
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,200
you can go through this stuff and you can recover.

318
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,740
I think that's missing from a lot of addiction photo essays and stuff like that.

319
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,400
People are perfectly happy to photograph the addicts,

320
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,540
the junkies, the torn down buildings, or
the desolate isolated places and they're

321
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,070
always.. a lot of the times seeing victims and they always never seem to recover and

322
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,940
never seems to be an end story to it apart from, look at these addicts.

323
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,940
So I wanted to show, "look at this addict" coming from me as the recovered addict.

324
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,090
[Susan] When Graham first started talking about or proposing that he might show these images

325
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,090
to some photo editors, or think about publishing them, or exhibiting them,

326
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,440
my first reaction was that that was a
really scary thought, you know,

327
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,620
not negative, that he shouldn't do it, but
just concern about how these images

328
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,300
would be interpreted. So one of the
things that I suggested is that if he

329
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,550
was going to publish these images that
he include text accompanying the images,

330
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:12,040
that he tell his story so that he could, to some degree, shape how people reacted to them.

331
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,460
[Graham] My response from magazines was immediate. I sent emails to a couple of

332
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,460
picture editors. It was a couple of embedded pictures and was then like half an hour,

333
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,380
which is unknown for picture editors,
they were back at me saying

334
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,580
"Oh we love these. Can you bring them in? Can you show us more? We're really interested in publishing them".

335
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,980
We eventually decided to publish them was text by Susan, which was an interview basically

336
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,720
in New York magazine and it got so much feedback but

337
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,620
because we mulled over it for so long, it
was a really well-done piece and

338
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,360
it really resonated and I was really happy with it and the feedback from the people that saw it

339
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,752
(the audience) was amazing.

340
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,100
[Susan] So after the article it first

341
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,910
appeared in New York Magazine in print
and obviously there was an accompanying

342
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,080
piece online that did have the
photography and the text and some audio,

343
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,980
we literally sat looking at the computer
waiting for the comments to start scrolling in.

344
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,860
There was a person who thought that Graham had faked this whole thing

345
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,120
in order to get published and you know potentially get an exhibit,

346
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,650
and that really sparked this thread
about whether or not someone who was a

347
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,000
heroin addict really would have the capacity to set a self timer and take pictures of himself?

348
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,380
and I think that gets back to this idea that

349
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,780
we don't really understand or believe in the
concept of someone who can be somewhat functional

350
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,260
or in some cases very functional while using drugs

351
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,180
but there are myriad stories of people who, you know, have held down careers as doctors,

352
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,090
surgeons, lawyers, actors, professors and
then it comes out that you know they had

353
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,140
a serious addiction but yet I think sometimes

354
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,880
because we don't see that depicted in visual imagery we just.. we can't wrap our heads around it.

355
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,040
So in a lot of the Guardian comments there was just this skepticism

356
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,640
"Was he really a heroin addict? Was he really using?"

357
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,540
[Graham] From there it got picked up by Al-Jazeera, The Huffington Post and

358
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,130
that led me to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery

359
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,440
where the curator there approached me and says..

360
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,600
"Listen I've never seen anything like this before,

361
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,460
can you bring these to me and let me see these pictures? These are amazing".

362
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,420
So I went across and met with her and I took maybe..

363
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,200
I made a whole bunch of 8 by 10 prints, maybe about 80 or 90.

364
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,340
We looked through them. I left them with her.

365
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,620
I came back 3 months later, we whittled it down to like 50.

366
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,280
I came back 3 months later we whittled it down to like 25

367
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,420
images that were really powerful and succinct,

368
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,400
and we submitted them to the board of the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery

369
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,700
to see if we could get an acquisition.

370
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,020
To my surprise, I woke up one morning

371
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,380
checked my email and there was an email
from Annie Lydon who's the curator saying

372
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,544
"You'll never believe it.

373
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:02,880
They decided to acquire all 25 images for the national collection" -

374
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,000
which was mind-boggling to me.

375
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,959
To think back to taking these pictures in these dark places, in these isolated painful times that

376
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,600
you know, the whole.. all through the boards and committees of the National Portrait Gallery

377
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,380
(which is a very traditional body
of people) found this body of work so

378
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,220
compelling and powerful that they would acquire it for their national collection

379
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,840
which was a real.. it was really great for me.

380
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,460
[Susan] It was really a catalyst to these conversations that

381
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,640
I think people were really anxious and interested in having.

382
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,739
So, the series of images became sort of a
gateway to these conversations about

383
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,400
not just addiction but, how do you get clean?

384
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,680
You know, what is that like? What is that Process?

385
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,820
What did you do, what helped you?

386
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,300
Not that Graham's route to recovery is something that is going to work for everybody,

387
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,360
but I think the more we talk about it

388
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,660
the more we can kind of learn about what works in different circumstances.

389
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,899
One of the reasons that
we're we mostly see images of addiction

390
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,140
and addiction sort of at the far end of
the spectrum

391
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,240
is just the shame and the stigma that surrounds substance use disorder.

392
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,720
The imagery is always about the person who's really lost everything.

393
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,160
They're really down and out that's something that's also missing you know from the media

394
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,120
and kind of popular representations of addiction is that recovery piece of it.

395
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
Because you know it's maybe not as interesting visually..

396
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,040
Graham keeps asking, "How do you depict recovery?"

397
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,400
"What do you show about that?"

398
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,699
Where, with addiction, I think there is that
voyeurism factor it's something that

399
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:46,899
people largely haven't seen, although I would argue that maybe,

400
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,349
at this point we have seen a lot of
images of needles going into veins, or

401
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:56,319
people passed out, or you know, crack
pipes, or drugs kind of close up, and

402
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,540
I think where we're at now is kind of
trying to wrap our heads around

403
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:07,120
"What is that project or story that you can tell about how people get clean and sober?"

404
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Some people recover without doing you
know, a rehab, or without going to AA.

405
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,440
Other people really rely on those peer
supports. So, I think you know,

406
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,440
finding a way to capture those stories and capture that process is something that we're both really interested in right now.

407
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,280
[Graham] I think it's the most important thing I've I've really done, is put this body work out there

408
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:36,340
and engage with people and.. you know, as
someone who's been the addict and the recovered person

409
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,980
and revealing that part in my life and

410
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,200
trying to take away some of that shame and trying to take away some of that negativity

411
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,400
that surrounds addiction and giving people that option that,

412
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,500
"You know what? You can go that dark and that deep and end up the places I've been

413
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,540
and still pull yourself out of that and find recovery

414
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,660
and rebuild your life again, and it's not easy.

415
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,660
There was times where it were really, really, really tough.

416
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,120
But you know what?

417
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,860
Being clean is 8 million times better than being a heroin addict. That's for sure.

418
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,240
I mean, it's been a crazy journey,
and a long journey, and a tough journey

419
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,520
for some of the friends who've seen me go
through that (yourself included), but ..

420
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,600
at least I came away from it with something that can help change other people's minds

421
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,860
and bring light to what people can go through and that's been really, really important for me.

422
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,200
[Jonathan] Yeah.   Hah.

423
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,300
[Graham] Was that alright?

424
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,500
[Jonathan] Yeah. Yeah. You got me.

425
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,860
[Graham] Aye alright, sorry.

426
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
[Jonathan] Is there anything else you wanted to say?

427
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
[Graham] Nah, I think that's about it.

428
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,180
[Susan] So now that you've heard my story and Graham's  story and listened to, you know,

429
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,600
these interviews I kind of challenge you
to think about what we've talked about

430
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,630
and how much of the focus has been on
addiction and the process of, you know,

431
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,860
going from being a successful photographer, to someone who was..  had lost everything

432
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,080
and ended up in a prison cell. Versus the time spent on, you know,

433
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,220
talking about and addressing Graham's
recovery and the treatment he got and

434
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,560
you know, how that worked. Because I think we all have to step back and see how

435
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,850
we're representing this issue and sort
of challenge ourselves to think about it

436
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,440
in different ways and so challenge some of the stereotypes we have about,

437
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,500
"What does addiction look like?"

438
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:42,520
Is it just the photographs that we see of people like Graham who are slumped over with a needle in their arm?

439
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,300
And when we talk about it why are we
drawn to that imagery more than to

440
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:54,800
images of people sitting in circles or interviews of people talking about what they had to overcome,

441
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:00,220
the peer support they got, you know, and some... that is in some sense it's harder to photograph

442
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,890
it's harder to get access but

443
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,040
that's part of the process that we need to be seeing and talking about and thinking about

444
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:11,960
because that's really key to figuring out what works to help people who are struggling with addiction

445
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,480
