    description: >-
      In this, the second of three episodes, new participants revisit some of the themes of episode one and their alternate perspectives enable us to build on those discussions. We move from the self-portraiture of Graham Macindoe, to the participatory practices of Jeffery Stockbridge and his Kensington Blues project.
