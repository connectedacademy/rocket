1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
my name is Jeffrey Stockbridge I'm in

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:10,260
currently in South Philadelphia and it

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:13,910
is snowing outside so my dad gave me my

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,190
first camera when I was 16 years old I

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,680
was a skateboarder and I started

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,470
skateboarding when I was 11 when you're

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,519
a skateboarder in the city it gives you

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,470
a lot of freedom to go into any

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,750
neighborhood you want looking for

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,079
interesting obstacles to skateboard on

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,260
and interesting tricks to do they

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,450
brought me to see different parts of the

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,149
city that I probably would have never

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,450
seen otherwise and having a camera with

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,629
me gave me even another reason to be

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,629
there

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,500
growing up in Maryland I wasn't far from

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,660
Philadelphia and only two hours away and

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,649
Philadelphia is and has been for a long

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,640
time the East Coast Capitol escape that

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:08,250
the impulse to skateboard in the park is

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,830
so strong it's like one of the best

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,340
places like to skate you know I mean

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,320
it's like skating paradise so I

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,689
naturally when I got out of high school

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,530
I moved to Philadelphia so I guess it

27
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,740
wasn't until my junior year the end of

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,170
my third year in college that I had

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,280
first started to create a body work that

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:39,090
had some serious and this to it so let

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,570
me break it down for you when I moved to

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,729
Philly

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,729
this was my first time really living in

34
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,790
a city and I lived in poorer

35
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,770
neighborhoods in West Philadelphia where

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,960
there were a lot of abandoned houses

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,670
each of these eminently hazardous

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,219
properties these hundred properties are

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,630
all a time bomb ready to go off and it

40
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,320
is only by the grace of God that they

41
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,970
don't go off on any particular day

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,430
take a look at this abandoned Shack

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,500
behind me for three years it was on the

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,690
city's list of most dangerous buildings

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,340
slated to be destroyed this past fall I

46
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,530
was curious I wanted to know where these

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,270
houses came from why were they abandoned

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,990
you know what happened to the people

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:24,730
that had lived there so I started to

50
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:27,070
investigate that it was remarkably easy

51
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,110
to gain access sometimes you could walk

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,120
right in the front door sometimes a

53
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,580
window would be open you could go in the

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,830
back door or a cellar door and I would

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,510
basically find a way to get inside these

56
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,330
abandoned houses and I would make

57
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,520
photographs of the interiors very

58
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,560
interested in capturing a sense of the

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,070
memory of the past occupants who lived

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,620
there I also found incredible artifacts

61
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,800
left behind old letters family

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,690
photographs journal entries by the

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,280
people who had once called this

64
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:07,959
structure a home so it was through

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,549
photographing these abandoned houses for

66
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,580
years I did that for maybe four or five

67
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:16,120
years and I had met a lot of people

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,280
during that time and at first I you know

69
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,070
honestly I was kind of scared of them

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,600
I didn't really want to have any contact

71
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,910
with the people that I was meeting

72
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,670
inside these abandoned houses they were

73
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,620
homeless they were addicted to drugs I

74
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,560
didn't necessarily feel safe in their

75
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,180
presence after a while that all changed

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,040
I started to grow more comfortable

77
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,910
talking to the people that I was running

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,550
into right

79
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:45,350
yeah I was born and raised here at 1965

80
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,000
making connections with people in the

81
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,950
neighborhoods that I was photographing

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Oh God's Way tell me if I can if I think

83
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,100
I can do these drugs again and shoot

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,480
heroin in my arm it's like he gives me a

85
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,640
little sign look down on your arm you

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,770
idiot that's like me with these tattoos

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,270
and I realized that hey here's a third

88
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,330
element of the project that I totally

89
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,310
forgot about the actual people that are

90
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,590
still living in the neighborhood that

91
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,660
everybody else a band my children I'd

92
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,190
have to look them in the eye before I

93
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,140
actually brought it up to my face

94
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,390
I got them right here when I stopped

95
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:24,010
drinking in o-fag I had met a woman

96
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,840
named Millie who was selling her body

97
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,670
inside of a crack house she was

98
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,290
literally going to different crack

99
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:36,170
houses around West Philadelphia in

100
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:43,610
search of people with drugs that she

101
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:49,000
could exchange sex for drugs and I found

102
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:51,800
her story to just be harrowing it was

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,870
incredible I mean I can't tell you why

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,150
Millie decided to talk to me you're

105
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,830
gonna have to ask her who knows when the

106
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,750
last time was that somebody asked her

107
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,580
about her life or asked her where she

108
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,310
came where she grew up

109
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,710
or how she survived you know I think

110
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:12,650
it's as simple as saying that you know I

111
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:17,560
was you know a disruption to her daily

112
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:20,750
routine and that may have been

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,690
interesting to her maybe that's it I

114
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,850
don't know I'm speculation so I

115
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,400
we hung out one afternoon I photographed

116
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,540
her while the Sun set she told me her

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,990
life story and it was this single

118
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:40,100
interaction that really spurred me in a

119
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,530
new direction and was the reason that I

120
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,570
started to visit Kensington and start

121
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,570
the new body war Kensington blues

122
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,099
when I'm walking down the street in

123
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,559
Kensington and I'm interested in making

124
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:59,429
photographs I'm just walking the streets

125
00:05:55,559 --> 00:06:01,919
and I'm just stopping I'm saying hi to

126
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:03,499
people I'm talking to them it's never

127
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,860
about hey can I take your photograph

128
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:10,439
it's always hey I was going today you

129
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,879
know what's going on just trying to have

130
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,009
a conversation with people like they're

131
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,319
human beings not like I'm after

132
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,309
something not like I'm only here for one

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:25,709
reason because I'm not the first time we

134
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:29,610
met I had been clean for almost two

135
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:34,139
years I did 13 months in jail and I was

136
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:37,559
in a recovery house and as soon as I

137
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,439
finished probation relapsed and you know

138
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:42,569
I probably been out on the street for

139
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,759
maybe two and a half months at this

140
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:50,189
point back with a pimp

141
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:54,119
and I was extremely disappointed in

142
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:58,589
myself but at the same time like I had

143
00:06:54,119 --> 00:07:04,169
told you before I never really expected

144
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:08,459
myself to even make it to this age you

145
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:11,579
know which was 30 whatever and expected

146
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:14,639
myself to fully wind up as just an old

147
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,029
junkie not like you enough to overdose

148
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,029
and die

149
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:26,990
I remember when you approached me I had

150
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:33,730
heard about you from other other girls

151
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:36,590
and I remember when you approached me

152
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,150
thinking you know of course the first

153
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,290
thing I think when somebody says I'd

154
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:45,500
like to take a photo of you my first

155
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:50,470
thought is you want to take you know

156
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:53,470
dirty photos of me not this and

157
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:57,710
interview me and actually care about you

158
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:01,820
know what was going on in my life and

159
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:06,440
how I wound up there etc I liked what

160
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:10,060
you were doing I was kind of I don't

161
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,060
know if excited is the right word but

162
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:20,229
yeah I was excited that somebody was

163
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,229
looking at me as a human being and not

164
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,380
somebody that sticks a needle in their

165
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:32,030
arm every day a nuisance to society I

166
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:38,530
always been interested in telling my

167
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:44,780
story on my computer I probably have

168
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:47,540
maybe almost 10 you know beginnings of

169
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,360
you know my own book I'd like to write

170
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,270
about my life you know I've been written

171
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,270
about several times by by this point and

172
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:06,950
for someone to tell me that after seven

173
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:11,480
years they still think about me and

174
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:14,540
impact that my story you or me as a

175
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:19,430
person has had on their life to the

176
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:22,790
point to where they remember you know so

177
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,990
many details about me that they want to

178
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,990
write about me is

179
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:37,020
of course flattering and a good end dad

180
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:42,840
okay but makes me realize that you know

181
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:45,090
I I want my story to be told and I would

182
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:51,090
like to tell it myself you know

183
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:53,460
I think that that makes the people that

184
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm photographing a meeting want to

185
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,810
share their story for that specific

186
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:04,260
reason they want to be remembered and

187
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:06,650
Krista says the exact same thing she

188
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,650
doesn't know when she gets into a car if

189
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,180
she's gonna get back out of that car

190
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,670
she's hopping you know in the

191
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,400
automobiles with strangers turning

192
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:22,100
tricks for twenty forty sixty dollars a

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:25,980
date you know there's a lot of

194
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,630
unpredictability there and I think that

195
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,400
that was one of the main reasons that

196
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,930
she wanted to share her story with me I

197
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,930
mean that's the scar right here

198
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:40,680
you know guy picked me up beat the shit

199
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,550
out of me split my face up and broke

200
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,970
three bones in my face and basically

201
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,070
said to me the reason I picked on

202
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,020
someone like you is because no one

203
00:10:50,070 --> 00:11:00,600
noticed no one would notice if you

204
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:07,080
disappeared and it's true and sadly you

205
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,470
know it's true and so yeah absolutely

206
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:14,190
you know that play a part in it kind of

207
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:17,190
like well you know what I better get

208
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,040
some of this stuff out there in case I

209
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,290
get into the wrong car one of these days

210
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:27,120
and then maybe there'll be something

211
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:31,910
left behind of being of how I felt you

212
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,910
know of what was really going on

213
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:47,380
any person with a you know a little bit

214
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,100
of knowledge of photography or just

215
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,050
representation in general would

216
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,810
recognize that a photograph of somebody

217
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,440
at one point in time their life doesn't

218
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:00,590
need to be a statement for who that

219
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,420
person is for their entire life you know

220
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,630
like this photograph is just

221
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,420
representing a moment in time okay and

222
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,030
that's what Krista talks about a moment

223
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,860
in time she likes knowing that she likes

224
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,720
being able to look at photographs of

225
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,790
what she used to look like at a certain

226
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,180
moment in time so that she can remember

227
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,950
who she was then because she's changing

228
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:27,110
and she's not the same person she was

229
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:33,310
that she's completely different I have

230
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:39,500
always always wanted any kind of photo

231
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:42,290
from when I was using in my life at one

232
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:47,090
point I tried to get copies of all of my

233
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,190
mug shots throughout the years and the

234
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:53,180
Philadelphia Police Department told me

235
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:57,440
that no I could not have copies because

236
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:00,470
my image was the property of the

237
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:07,250
Philadelphia Police Department and I

238
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:11,510
said well that photo may be your

239
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:14,690
property but it's still my image I'm not

240
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:18,560
asking you for the originals I'm asking

241
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:21,770
you for even a photocopy of it just

242
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,250
because I like yeah I like to see the

243
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:29,720
progression I like to it's a reminder to

244
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,610
me yeah like this like I don't want to

245
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,300
look like this again you know I mean

246
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,870
like it's just a reminder she's grown a

247
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,270
lot

248
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,410
it doesn't just because she's gone back

249
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:44,720
to using here or there doesn't mean that

250
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:48,080
you know that she is just an addict for

251
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,260
life I mean to get clean it takes time

252
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,070
you have to be stumble when you're

253
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,750
walking

254
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,930
Lu you that's part of the process so I

255
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,340
never feel like when I'm photographing

256
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:06,460
people on the street who are deep in

257
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:09,440
their addiction as if I'm forever

258
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:13,160
defining them as an addict I don't feel

259
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,330
that way at all I feel as though I'm in

260
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,820
a unique position to get to know

261
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:22,370
somebody when they are in a very

262
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,740
vulnerable state I'm in a unique

263
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,870
position to spend time with somebody

264
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,560
when they need somebody to spend time

265
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,900
with to tell you the truth no I do not

266
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,600
pay my subjects Kensington Blues is a

267
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:39,110
collaborative effort between myself and

268
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,340
the people that I photograph everyone I

269
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:45,950
photograph is a willing participant

270
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,210
they want their stories to be heard or

271
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,710
they want their image to be out there

272
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,570
you know they'll everyone I photograph

273
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,530
has different reasons for why they want

274
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,850
to do this you know sometimes it's they

275
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,740
actually just want a picture of

276
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:04,130
themselves that I could bring back to

277
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,750
them in a week sometimes they hope that

278
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,430
the picture will make it on the internet

279
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,110
so that their loved ones know that

280
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,740
they're still alive that they still

281
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,130
exist

282
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,320
it becomes very complex particularly an

283
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,970
environment like a street based

284
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,150
community in street based communities

285
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,410
are hustling communities those people

286
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,950
who are existing in those communities

287
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,630
have to find diverse ways to survive and

288
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,180
have to find diverse ways to meet their

289
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,710
diverse needs and some of those needs

290
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,690
can include life controlling drug

291
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:37,610
addictions and so I can imagine the

292
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,320
challenge when a photographer like

293
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,030
jeffery comes to that community and is a

294
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,340
part of that community and makes images

295
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,900
based in that community that it might be

296
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,940
really difficult for the members of that

297
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,550
community to accept that they are his

298
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,710
commercial venture in some senses you

299
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,510
know people think you know you're gonna

300
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,610
make millions of dollars off of this

301
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,340
book you know I can't believe he's

302
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,380
selling this book for $60 and he's only

303
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,080
giving 2% to

304
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:07,120
prevention point or whatever it is and

305
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:12,110
you know me trying to explain to people

306
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,660
you know like what he did this on his

307
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,360
own like he probably lost money doing

308
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,040
this so if there's ever a situation that

309
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,750
somebody reaches out and they're upset

310
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,030
about something I want to talk to them

311
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,980
you know I'm happy I am happy to have

312
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,720
that conversation with anybody I

313
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,440
photographed I really do

314
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,990
I mean I want to I want to feel as

315
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,760
though that I'm in a position to be like

316
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,320
hey like look this is this is kind of

317
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,700
like an education let me explain

318
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,040
something to you you want to know how

319
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,910
much the book cost me $45,000 cost me

320
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,470
$45,000 you no matter how many years of

321
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,980
my life I spent photographing this stuff

322
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,010
about ten thus far okay film and

323
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,200
processing and time and effort

324
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:58,970
everything all told I will never break

325
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:01,970
even you know I have probably would

326
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,740
express cynicism over people with life

327
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,960
controlling drug addictions and people

328
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,920
who are experiencing homelessness and

329
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:14,620
people who are working in street by sex

330
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:17,450
work being the continued subject of

331
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,430
documentary photographers but the

332
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,610
project has definitely endeared itself

333
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:26,600
to me because of the longevity of

334
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:33,050
commitment because of the fact that

335
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:35,780
Jeffrey is clearly not entirely resolved

336
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,110
in his methodological approach the fact

337
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,030
that he is trying to incorporate

338
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:49,190
people's own experiences in such a

339
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:52,490
rigorous way the whole especially in the

340
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,770
media the whole debate about whether

341
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:58,660
addiction is

342
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,330
a disease or a choice I'm I'm a drug

343
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:05,260
addict I'm a person that if I have a

344
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,270
drink I can't stop and so it would be

345
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,370
following your ideology that I'm

346
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,130
choosing to do that that I'm choosing

347
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,840
exactly my not my ideology is my belief

348
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,670
yes you do choose this is the stigma

349
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,550
that people with substance use disorders

350
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,280
face every single day the only way to

351
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:25,270
solve the drug problem is through

352
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,840
toughness when I was in China and other

353
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,550
places by the way I said mr. president

354
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,430
do you have a drug problem

355
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:38,550
no no we do not I said what do you

356
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:42,130
tribute that to well the death penalty

357
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:46,990
is something that I can't help or am I

358
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:50,760
just a scumbag am I just you know saying

359
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,950
fuck you everybody that cares about me

360
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,340
we have this disproportionate focus on

361
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,280
addiction in the media that is when we

362
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,650
have the vast majority of people who use

363
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,110
drugs do not meet criteria for addiction

364
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,660
but yet that's where our focus is why do

365
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,760
we have this disproportionate focus the

366
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,960
drugs that we're talking about our drugs

367
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,610
like crack cocaine heroin even in dma or

368
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,550
summative recreational drugs when we

369
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,160
talk about drugs in our popular culture

370
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:23,980
almost eat immediately the refrain is

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,840
addiction now the thing that the

372
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,910
listener should know is that the vast

373
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,520
majority of people that use any of those

374
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,160
drugs are not addicted so you only have

375
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,870
about 10 to 25 percent of the people who

376
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,510
use any of those drugs who will become

377
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,910
addicted so that means that most people

378
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,400
use these drugs are not addictive if

379
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,790
most of the people who are using these

380
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,060
drugs are not addicted then why in the

381
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,590
hell do all of the movies or the vast

382
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,990
majority of the movies that you see

383
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,390
about drugs deal with addiction

384
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:59,380
well because addiction is sexy and you

385
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:02,170
watch it's a lot less sexy to say watch

386
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,060
a movie about someone who uses heroin on

387
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,160
the weekend and then goes to work on

388
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,900
Monday and Tuesday whenever

389
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,580
they're scheduled to go to work and they

390
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,560
handle all of their responsibilities

391
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,720
that that would be a boring movie so you

392
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,650
have addiction because addiction is more

393
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:20,590
sexy or sexier and sex

394
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:23,710
here terms like the functional attic or

395
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,410
the functioning addict that's a misnomer

396
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,740
there's no such thing if someone is

397
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,170
functioning and they are not having any

398
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,380
problems with their drug use they're not

399
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:38,950
an addict addiction is defined by these

400
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,580
social and behavioral disruptions simply

401
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,260
because somebody is using crack cocaine

402
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,530
and their function doesn't make them an

403
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,280
addict for we can think about people who

404
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:53,230
drink alcohol on a regular basis we

405
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,020
don't call them functional addicts or

406
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,840
functional alcoholics we particularly in

407
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,690
the UK we call those people citizen I

408
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,840
have seen local media clips where Fox

409
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,060
News drives up and down Kensington and

410
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,830
they're filming underneath the tunnels

411
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:14,560
and they are portraying the situation

412
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,390
like like a safari our Hank Flynn took a

413
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,280
trip to camp scene 10 today that's where

414
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,790
some longtime residents are fed up with

415
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,380
this that is a heroin needle lying on

416
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,800
the side of a street right next to a

417
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,450
school

418
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,280
Jerri Mariner says he'd never leave

419
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,020
Kensington he raised his family there

420
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,370
but look at these pictures he took he's

421
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,010
sick and tired of the heroin trade

422
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,380
happening right on his stoop the selling

423
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,390
the using the prostitution this is it

424
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,790
he's at his wits end I took the trash

425
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,670
out two weeks ago and there's a dude

426
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,350
later my trash I mean it's where he

427
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,900
belongs really and that's my opinion

428
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,640
I mean people feel sorry for his people

429
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,090
I don't they're shooting it from their

430
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,380
car window I mean this isn't journalism

431
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,790
they're too scared to get out of their

432
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,840
car and talk to these people they

433
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,460
wouldn't know how to talk to these

434
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,830
people because the guy running the show

435
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,420
is wearing a buttoned up blue shirt and

436
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,700
he's already got his mind made up about

437
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,560
who these people are that type of

438
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,720
coverage in the media is exactly why I

439
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,370
do what I do because I think that that's

440
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,540
bullshit and I need to fight back

441
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,540
against that kind of stuff

442
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,350
we're not looking at more pictures of

443
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,809
recovery because we're still in a crisis

444
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,960
mode America has an insatiable appetite

445
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,630
for prescription opioids opioids are now

446
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,850
the biggest drug epidemic in American

447
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,440
history

448
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,309
Time magazine just put out a piece with

449
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,470
James Nachtwey

450
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:38,770
you know they hired a war photographer

451
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:44,530
to photograph a war as they saw it this

452
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:48,900
is an epidemic and when war is happening

453
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:55,659
you tend to see photographs of battle

454
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:58,809
not of victories maybe its inherent to

455
00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:00,970
the way the media works as a tool for

456
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:06,190
social change I think a lot of people

457
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:10,090
would presume that showing how horrible

458
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:16,390
a situation is would be the most

459
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:19,210
effective way to try to help a scenario

460
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,360
and I did that myself for a number of

461
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,960
years but now I think it's most

462
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:30,549
important that I show that recovery is

463
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:34,390
possible and prove to people that you

464
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:37,179
can come back from an addiction I think

465
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:40,690
that that will prove to be equally as

466
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:42,549
effective because it's a significant

467
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,590
part of the truth it's a significant

468
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:48,940
part of the story that we've been

469
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:50,289
overlooking you know I can see that over

470
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,870
the period of time that he was there

471
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:55,539
that he was really learning how to tell

472
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,929
a story like this in a non stereotypical

473
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:04,030
way or in a way that transcended some of

474
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:07,030
those photographers you know heroic

475
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,080
author and subject as poor person that

476
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,669
needs to be saved

477
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,509
Tropes and I think as a you know as a

478
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:18,370
respectful portrayal of people who are

479
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:20,379
these kinds of experiences that we might

480
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,019
look down upon in society this project

481
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:26,559
is is significantly meaningful because

482
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:29,769
it it doesn't just treat them like they

483
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,279
are these physical props for selling

484
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:35,039
some sort of fantastic idea that he is

485
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,720
you know the intrepid photojournalist

486
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,999
showcasing misery perfectly beautifully

487
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,399
and it holds much more weight for me now

488
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:44,139
as a project than it did when I was just

489
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,519
seeing these kinds of images on

490
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:48,999
Instagram which i think is a poor

491
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,399
platform for project like this for me

492
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:56,639
being involved in this has been a

493
00:24:51,399 --> 00:25:00,490
positive thing I like I said earlier I

494
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:03,399
you know like what you're doing I

495
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:09,610
thought it was a great idea

496
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:15,220
and I still do and I like kind of like

497
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:17,340
proud to be a part of it and like proud

498
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:21,700
to be a part of something where

499
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,840
someone's trying to tell our side of the

500
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,110
story

501
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,379
that's the goal ultimately to humanize

502
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:32,740
the situation that they're in because we

503
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:36,159
as a society have heard way too long

504
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:39,299
been dehumanizing these people been

505
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,419
demonizing these people been declaring

506
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:45,869
drug addicts as morally corrupt and

507
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,869
that's bullshit

508
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,440
you
