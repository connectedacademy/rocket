      In this, the third of our series on Depictions Of Addiction, New York based photographer Nina Berman interviews her long term subject Kimberly Wish. Industry stalwart and critical thinker Stephen Mayes reflects on the audience perspective and Professor Mark Kleiman of New York University again challenges our thinking on addiction and forces us to revisit our earlier discussions.
